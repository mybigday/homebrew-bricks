  # CTOR Beta installs side-by-side with bricks-ctor (distinct app bundle + app id)
  # but SHARES the ~/.bricks-project-desktop data dir with it. That dir is
  # intentionally omitted below so uninstalling beta never deletes the release
  # install's sessions/projects/settings. Only beta-namespaced paths are zapped.
